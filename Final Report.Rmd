# Statisticial Analysis of the factors that correlate to Plastic Waste Generation

## Introduction

|   Plastic Waste and plastic pollution is a growing global problem. Current end-of-life processing of plastic are insufficient for dealing with the mass of plastic production in a environmentally sustainable manner. Only a total of XXX % of Plastic ever generated has been recycled since 1955, and today's recycling rate is at XXX %. Incineration is another end-of-life process for plastics, however incinerated plastic contaminate the surrounding air quality, effecting the health of local residents and contributing green house gases. The most common end-of-life process for plastic is disposal, which includes both managed and un-managed disposal. However, most commercial plastics are not naturally degradable and plastic waste that is exposed to UV radiation will break down to micro-plastics which has a negitive effect on both environmental health as well as human health. These issues of waste management are compound by the anual increase in the production of plastics each year. Plastic production has increased from XXX % in 1950 to XXX % in 2021. 

|   To adress the issue of plastic waste, this study aims to investigate the the historic economical and social factors of political entities in 2010 that contributed to the generation of plastic waste generated in 2010. Entities in this case are recognized semi-independent political structures; examples include nation states, city-states, and overseas territories. 

## Methodology

|   Data was pull from open-sourced data bases, such as (INCLUDE EXAMPLES HERE), therefore The scope of this investigation was limited to the data that was available to us. We pulled plastic generation and plastic waste from our _our world in data_ and economic and social metrics such as GDP, population, economic growth, and wealth disparage. 

|   The compiled dataset had a high amount of missing values; very few observation had values for every factor. To cut out observation that had missing values would have reduced the dataset by too much to make a statistically meaningful analysis. Thus, to preserve as much data as possible we explored several methods of imputation. Random-Forest imputation was used as well as Predictive mean match.

|   There was concern about data that showed Informed missing; entities with smaller GPD are more likely to have missing data about plastic waste generation. However, since the alternative is forgoing any analysis we preceded with the imputation but remained mindful of possible short-comings of the analysis due to the possibility of informed missing data.

|   We explored several machine-learning methods, including supervised and un-supervised methods, using the imputed data and investigated different metrics to compare the models created. 

|   For the supervised machine-learning methods we needed to split the imputed data set to create a training-set and a testing-set, using a typical 70:30 ratio. All models were trained using the training-set, and final metrics were obtained by comparing the predictions of the testing-set and the actual response values. Using the regression created by the model we can understand the impact of each factor.

|   For the unsupervised learning methods we could not find correlations between the factors and the response, yet we will be about to find groups that share common elements. Using these groups we are able to see which factors are grouping entities together.
